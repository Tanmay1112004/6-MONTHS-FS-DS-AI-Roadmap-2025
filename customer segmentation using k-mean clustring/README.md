# 🎯 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering  

Welcome to the **Customer Segmentation Project** 🚀  
In this project, we use **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on their behavior and spending patterns.  
This helps businesses to **personalize marketing strategies, improve targeting, and boost ROI** 📈.
