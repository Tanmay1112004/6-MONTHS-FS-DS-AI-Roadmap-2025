# 🔌 Python MySQL Connector

### Production-Ready, Secure & Pooled Database Interface

> A lightweight, Pythonic abstraction layer for MySQL with connection pooling, environment-based configuration, and clean resource management.

---

## 📌 Overview

This utility provides a structured, production-friendly way to interact with MySQL databases using:

* ⚡ **Connection Pooling** for performance
* 🔐 **Environment Variable Security**
* 🐍 **Context Manager-based API**
* 🧩 Clean CRUD patterns
* 📝 Type-hinted implementation

Designed for backend systems, APIs, microservices, and data-driven applications.

### Execution Flow

```
Application Layer
      ↓
MySQLConnector Class
      ↓
Connection Pool Manager
      ↓
MySQL Server
```

Connections are reused efficiently instead of being created per request.

## ✨ Core Features

### ⚡ Connection Pooling

* Reuses active connections
* Reduces latency
* Prevents resource exhaustion
* Configurable pool size

---

### 🔐 Secure Credential Management

* Native `.env` integration
* Keeps secrets out of version control
* Production-friendly configuration

---

### 🐍 Pythonic Context Management

Uses `with` statements for automatic cleanup:

```python
with db.connection() as conn:
    results = conn.execute_query(query, params)
```

No manual connection closing.
No accidental leaks.

---

### 🛠 CRUD-Ready Design

Pre-structured patterns for:

* INSERT
* SELECT
* UPDATE
* DELETE

Supports parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

---

### 📝 Type Hints & Clean API

* IDE-friendly
* Better maintainability
* Stronger developer experience

---

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* MySQL 5.7+ / 8.0+

---

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python python-dotenv
```

---

### 3️⃣ Configure Environment

Create `.env`:

```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=admin
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
DB_NAME=app_db
POOL_SIZE=5
```

Or rename:

```
.env.example → .env
```

---

## 🚀 Usage Example

```python
from db_connector import MySQLConnector

db = MySQLConnector(
    host="localhost",
    user="admin",
    password="secure_password",
    database="app_db",
    pool_size=5
)

user_id = 42

with db.connection() as conn:
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"
    results = conn.execute_query(query, (user_id,))
    
    for user in results:
        print(f"Found User: {user['name']}")
```
