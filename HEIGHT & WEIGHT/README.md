# ⚖️ Weight Prediction App

A sleek and interactive **Streamlit web application** that predicts a person’s **weight (in kilograms)** based on their **height (in feet)** using a pre-trained **Machine Learning model**.

This project demonstrates how to take a trained ML model and **deploy it as a user-friendly web app**—the skill that actually matters in the real world.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🎨 **Modern UI** with gradient background and custom CSS styling
* 📏 **Simple User Input**: Height entered in feet
* ⚡ **Instant Predictions** powered by a pre-trained ML model
* 🧠 Model loaded efficiently using `pickle`
* 💡 Lightweight, fast, and beginner-friendly

Built to be clean, practical, and deployment-ready.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3**
* **Streamlit** – frontend + backend framework
* **NumPy** – numerical computations
* **Pickle** – loading the trained ML model
* **Pillow (PIL)** – image handling

Classic stack. Reliable. Production-friendly.
