# 📊 Household Descriptive Statistics Analysis

## 📖 Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a household dataset to uncover patterns in income, spending habits, and demographic distributions. By leveraging descriptive statistics, we transform raw data into actionable insights regarding financial health and household composition.

## 🗂 Dataset Summary

The analysis is based on a structured dataset containing:

* **Records:** 50
* **Features:** 7 (including Monthly Income, Expenses, EMI/Rent, and Household Size)
* **Objective:** To calculate central tendencies, measure dispersion, and visualize frequency distributions.

## 🔍 Key Statistical Insights

### 1. Central Tendency (Monthly Expenses)

Understanding where the "middle" of the data lies:
| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mean Expense** | ₹18,818.0 |
| **Median Expense** | ₹15,500.0 |
| **Mode (Most Frequent)** | ₹25,000 (8 households) |

### 2. Measures of Spread & Variation

Assessing the volatility and distribution of the data:

* **IQR (Interquartile Range):** ₹15,000
* **Standard Deviation:** Calculated for all primary numerical variables to identify outliers.
* **Coefficient of Variation (CV):** Used to compare relative variability (e.g., Stock A: `0.67` vs. Stock B: `0.5`).

## 🎨 Visualizations & EDA

We utilized `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib` to create high-impact visuals:

* **Distribution Analysis:** Histograms to identify the education levels of the "Highest Qualified Members."
* **Categorical Insights:** Bar plots showing the frequency of earning members per household.
* **Relational Trends:** Scatter and trend plots comparing **Monthly Income vs. Monthly Expense**.
