# 🚢 Titanic Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning

An end-to-end **data preprocessing pipeline** built on the legendary Titanic dataset.
This project is all about **getting the data right** before throwing fancy machine learning models at it.

Clean data = strong models. No shortcuts.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Before any ML model can cook, the **data must be solid**.

This repository walks through a real-world preprocessing workflow to transform raw Titanic data into a **clean, structured, ML-ready dataset**.

What’s covered:

* Cleaning messy, real-world data
* Handling missing values with **conditional mean imputation**
* Encoding categorical variables for ML compatibility
* Dropping irrelevant and noisy features
* Performing basic **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
* Visualizing survival trends by gender
* Delivering a dataset ready for model training

This is the kind of preprocessing recruiters *actually* expect you to know.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

✔ Improve data consistency and reliability
✔ Make features ML-friendly
✔ Apply industry-standard preprocessing techniques
✔ Build intuition using visualization and EDA

Simple goal: **better inputs → better outputs**.

### Features Used

* PassengerId
* Survived (Target variable)
* Pclass
* Sex → numerically encoded
* Age → missing values handled using conditional means
* SibSp
* Parch
* Embarked → numerically encoded

Only what matters. No fluff.

## 📊 Visual Analysis

The project includes visual insights to validate assumptions before modeling:

* 📌 Gender distribution (Male vs Female)
* 📌 Survival comparison based on gender

Quick visuals. Clear takeaways. Data-backed intuition.

## ✅ Final Output

A **cleaned, structured, ML-ready dataset** suitable for training:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* XGBoost
* Any other classification model

Preprocessing done right means model selection becomes easy.
