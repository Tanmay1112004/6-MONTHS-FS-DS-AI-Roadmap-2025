# Polynomial Regression

**Quick & practical README** — ready to drop into a GitHub repo. Clean, concise, and actionable.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repo demonstrates **Polynomial Regression** using scikit-learn. It shows when and why to prefer polynomial models over plain linear regression, how to generate polynomial features, visualize results, and avoid overfitting using regularization strategies.

## 📌 Core idea

Linear regression assumes a straight-line relationship between independent variable(s) (X) and dependent variable (y). Polynomial regression expands X into polynomial terms (x², x³, ...), allowing curved fits while still remaining linear in coefficients.

## ✅ When to use

- Relationship between X and y is nonlinear but smooth and continuous.
- Trend changes direction (convex → concave) and a simple curve can model it.
- Want an interpretable, lower-complexity alternative to complex non-linear ML models.

## ⚠️ Warning

Higher polynomial degree increases flexibility **and** the risk of overfitting. Use cross-validation and consider Ridge/Lasso regularization when needed.

## 📁 Files in this repo

- `Polynomial Regression.ipynb` — notebook with examples, visualizations, and step-by-step code.
- `README.md` — this file.
- `data/emp-salary.csv` — sample dataset (Position Level vs Salary).

## 🧭 Steps (what the notebook does)

1. Load libraries and dataset.
2. Fit simple linear regression (degree = 1).
3. Transform features with `PolynomialFeatures(degree=n)`.
4. Fit `LinearRegression()` on transformed features.
5. Visualize model vs data (scatter + curve).
6. Demonstrate model selection, cross-validation, and regularization (Ridge/Lasso).

## 🔧 Example (snippet)

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)
model = LinearRegression().fit(X_poly, y)
```

## 📊 Visualization

Notebook includes a plot comparing:

- Raw data points (scatter)
- Polynomial fit curve
- Optional higher-degree fits to show overfitting behavior

## 🧠 Interview-facing bullet points

- Degree 1 = linear regression.
- `PolynomialFeatures` auto-creates x^2, x^3, ... terms.
- Still linear in coefficients (β), non-linear in X.
- Overfitting risk increases with degree; regularize with Ridge/Lasso.

## 🔁 Next steps / suggestions

- Add K-Fold CV to choose degree and regularization strength.
- Compare polynomial regression to tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost) on the same dataset.
- Package reusable preprocessing + modeling pipeline with `Pipeline`.

If you want, I can:

- generate a full `requirements.txt` and `environment.yml` for conda/pip.
- create a polished GitHub README with badges and GitHub Actions CI.
- produce a downloadable `README.md` file for immediate use (I can attach it below).

Happy to iterate — tell me what style/length you prefer and I’ll update it.
