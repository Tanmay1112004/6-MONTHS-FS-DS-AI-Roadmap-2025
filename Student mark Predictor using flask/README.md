# 🎓 Student Mark Prediction Project

## 📋 Overview

The **Student Mark Prediction Project** is an **end-to-end machine learning application** that predicts exam scores based on students’ study hours. It combines **data preprocessing, model training, and a user-friendly web interface** to deliver real-time predictions.

This project showcases how **data science + web apps** can empower **students, educators, and institutions** to make better decisions around academic performance.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

Educational stakeholders often struggle to **quantify the link between study hours and performance**. This project solves that by:
✅ Helping **students** optimize their study schedules
✅ Allowing **educators** to identify at-risk students early
✅ Supporting **institutions** in effective resource allocation

## 📊 Dataset (Sample Predictions)

| Study Hours | Predicted Marks |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 4           | 66.19%          |
| 8           | 81.93%          |
| 10          | 89.80%          |
| 11          | 93.74%          |
| 12          | 97.68%          |

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

**Server Workflow**

```
Development → Staging → Production
```

* **Development**: Testing & validation environment
* **Production**: Live deployment with strict access controls

**Security Measures**

* 🔒 No production credentials in repo
* 🔒 Environment-based config management
* 🔒 Firewall + session timeout policies
* 🔒 Input validation & sanitization
