# 🎬 Next Word Generation using LSTM

A **Deep Learning–powered Next Word Prediction system** trained on the **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset**.
This project leverages **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks to predict and generate the next words in a sequence with contextual understanding.

To make it practical (and fun), the model is wrapped inside an **interactive Gradio web interface**, allowing real-time experimentation with text generation parameters.

## ✨ Highlights

* End-to-end **text preprocessing & tokenization**
* **LSTM-based neural network** for next-word prediction
* Training visualization with **loss & accuracy curves**
* Model persistence using `.h5` format
* **Interactive Gradio UI**

  * Adjustable number of predicted words
  * Top-K word selection for controlled randomness
* Sleek **dark-themed demo interface**

## 🧠 How It Works (High Level)

1. Movie titles are tokenized and converted into sequences
2. LSTM learns word dependencies and contextual patterns
3. Given a seed phrase, the model predicts the most probable next words
4. Gradio provides a real-time playground to test predictions

Simple pipeline. Solid ML fundamentals. Clean execution.
