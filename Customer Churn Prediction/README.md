# 🎯 **Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard**

An interactive and business-focused **churn prediction dashboard** built using **Gradio** and **scikit-learn**.
This tool demonstrates how organizations can **predict**, **compare**, and **visualize** customer churn risk in real-time — perfect for showcasing ML + UI skills in a practical business context.

The project simulates a **telecom industry scenario**, where churn likelihood depends on factors such as:

* **Monthly Charges** 💰
* **Contract Type** 📜
* **Internet Service** 🌐
* **Tenure (Months)** 📆

---

## ✨ **Core Highlights**

✔️ **Single Prediction Mode** → Predict churn for one customer with a probability visualization
✔️ **Random Example Generator** → Auto-fills realistic synthetic customer data
✔️ **Two-Customer Comparison Mode** → Side-by-side risk scoring & graphs
✔️ **Downloadable Dataset** → Synthetic telecom churn dataset for practice
✔️ **Prediction Export** → Save model outputs as JSON for reporting
✔️ **Model Card Included** → Clear description of assumptions, limitations & usage

This dashboard is designed to be **clean**, **interactive**, and **portfolio-ready**.

## 🧠 **Model Details**

* **Model Type:** Gradient Boosting Classifier
* **Dataset:** 2000-row synthetic telecom dataset
* **Feature Encoding:**

  * Contract: Month-to-month = 0, One year = 1, Two year = 2
  * InternetService: DSL = 0, Fiber optic = 1, No = 2
* **Note:**
  This is a **demonstration model**, built to explain concepts — not for production deployment.
  (Training & evaluation occur on the same dataset.)
