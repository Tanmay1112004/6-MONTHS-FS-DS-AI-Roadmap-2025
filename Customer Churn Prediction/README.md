# 🎯 Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard

An **interactive churn prediction dashboard** built with **Gradio + scikit-learn**, designed to demonstrate how businesses can predict and visualize customer churn risk in real time.

This project simulates a **telecom scenario** where customers may or may not churn based on:

* Monthly Charges 💰
* Contract Type 📜
* Internet Service 🌐
* Tenure (Months) 📆

The app provides:
✅ **Single Prediction Mode** → Predict churn risk for one customer (with probability chart)
✅ **Random Example Button** → Auto-fills fields with synthetic sample customer data
✅ **Compare Two Customers Mode** → Side-by-side churn prediction and visualization
✅ **Downloadable Dataset** → Synthetic dataset for exploration & practice
✅ **Export Predictions** → Save results as JSON for reporting/business analysis
✅ **Model Card & Notes** → Explains model assumptions + guidance on inputs

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Clone Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/churn-dashboard.git
cd churn-dashboard
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run App

```bash
python app.py
```

You’ll get a local + public (share) link.

## 🧠 Model Details

* **Algorithm:** Gradient Boosting Classifier (scikit-learn)
* **Data:** Synthetic (2000 rows) → generated with rules to mimic real churn behavior
* **Encodings:**

  * Contract → Month-to-month = 0, One year = 1, Two year = 2
  * InternetService → DSL = 0, Fiber optic = 1, No = 2
* **Important Note:** This is a **toy demo model**, **not production-ready**. Accuracy numbers are inflated since training + evaluation are on the same dataset.
