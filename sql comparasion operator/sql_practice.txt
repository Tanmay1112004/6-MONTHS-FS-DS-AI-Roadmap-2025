-- SQL Practice Script
-- This script demonstrates SQL operators, expressions, and basic database operations.
-- It creates a CUSTOMERS table, populates it with data, and showcases various SQL queries.
-- Suitable for execution in MySQL or any compatible SQL compiler.

-- 1. Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS TUTORIALSPOINT;
USE TUTORIALSPOINT;

-- 2. Create the CUSTOMERS table
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
    ID INT NOT NULL,
    NAME VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    AGE INT NOT NULL,
    ADDRESS CHAR(25),
    SALARY DECIMAL(18, 2),
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

-- 3. Insert data into CUSTOMERS table
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID, NAME, AGE, ADDRESS, SALARY)
VALUES 
    (1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00),
    (2, 'Khilan', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00),
    (3, 'kaushik', 23, 'Kota', 2000.00),
    (4, 'Chaitali', 25, 'Mumbai', 6500.00),
    (5, 'Hardik', 27, 'Bhopal', 8500.00),
    (6, 'Komal', 22, 'MP', 4500.00),
    (7, 'Muffy', 24, 'Indore', 10000.00);

-- 4. Arithmetic Operators Examples
-- Addition
SELECT 10 + 20 AS Addition_Result;

-- Multiplication
SELECT 10 * 20 AS Multiplication_Result;

-- Division
SELECT 10 / 5 AS Division_Result;

-- Modulus
SELECT 12 % 5 AS Modulus_Result;

-- 5. Comparison Operators Examples
-- Select records where SALARY > 5000
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE SALARY > 5000;

-- Select records where SALARY = 2000
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE SALARY = 2000;

-- Select records where SALARY != 2000
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE SALARY != 2000;

-- Select records where SALARY >= 6500
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE SALARY >= 6500;

-- 6. Logical Operators Examples
-- Using AND: Select records where AGE >= 25 AND SALARY >= 6500
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE >= 25 AND SALARY >= 6500;

-- Using OR: Select records where AGE >= 25 OR SALARY >= 6500
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE >= 25 OR SALARY >= 6500;

-- Using NOT: Select records where AGE IS NOT NULL
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE IS NOT NULL;

-- Using LIKE: Select records where NAME starts with 'Ko'
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE NAME LIKE 'Ko%';

-- Using IN: Select records where AGE is 25 or 27
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE IN (25, 27);

-- Using BETWEEN: Select records where AGE is between 25 and 27
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE BETWEEN 25 AND 27;

-- Using EXISTS: Select AGE where SALARY > 6500 exists
SELECT AGE FROM CUSTOMERS 
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT AGE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE SALARY > 6500);

-- Using ALL: Select records where AGE is greater than all ages with SALARY > 6500
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS 
WHERE AGE > ALL (SELECT AGE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE SALARY > 6500);

-- Using ANY: Select records where AGE is greater than any age with SALARY > 6500
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS 
WHERE AGE > ANY (SELECT AGE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE SALARY > 6500);

-- 7. Boolean Expression Example
-- Fetch records where SALARY = 10000
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE SALARY = 10000;

-- 8. Numeric Expression Examples
-- Simple arithmetic expression
SELECT (15 + 6) AS ADDITION;

-- Aggregate function: Count total records
SELECT COUNT(*) AS RECORDS FROM CUSTOMERS;

-- 9. Date Expression Example
-- Fetch current timestamp
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS Current_Timestamp;

-- 10. Create Table from Another Table
-- Create SALARY table from CUSTOMERS
CREATE TABLE SALARY AS 
SELECT ID, SALARY 
FROM CUSTOMERS;

-- 11. Update Query Examples
-- Update ADDRESS for customer with ID = 6
UPDATE CUSTOMERS 
SET ADDRESS = 'Pune' 
WHERE ID = 6;

-- Update all ADDRESS and SALARY values
UPDATE CUSTOMERS 
SET ADDRESS = 'Pune', SALARY = 1000.00;

-- 12. Delete Query Examples
-- Delete customer with ID = 6
DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS 
WHERE ID = 6;

-- 13. Drop Table Example
-- Drop the SALARY table
DROP TABLE SALARY;

-- 14. Drop Database Example (Commented to prevent accidental execution)
-- DROP DATABASE TUTORIALSPOINT;
