# 📚 SQL Mastery Learning Repository

Welcome to the **SQL Learning Repository**! This project is a curated roadmap for mastering the language of data. Developed under the mentorship of **Prakash Sir**, it bridges the gap between basic syntax and professional-grade data manipulation.

## 📋 Curriculum Overview

This repository isn't just a collection of files; it's a structured learning path covering the core pillars of Database Management Systems (DBMS).

### 1. Data Manipulation & Operations (`sql_practice.sql`)

A hands-on script designed for execution in MySQL or PostgreSQL environments.

* **CRUD Operations:** Master `CREATE`, `READ` (Select), `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
* **Complex Expressions:** Practice with Boolean logic, Numeric calculations, and Date manipulations.
* **The Operators Toolkit:** * *Arithmetic:* Basic math on data fields.
* *Comparison:* Filtering with precision.
* *Logical:* Chaining conditions for complex reporting.



### 2. Theoretical Foundation (`sql_learning.tex`)

A professional LaTeX-compiled guide (PDF ready) that acts as a technical manual for SQL operators and expressions. Ideal for academic review or interview preparation.

### 3. Professional Outreach (`linkedin_post_sql_learning.txt`)

A pre-formatted template to help you document your "Learning in Public" journey, specifically optimized for LinkedIn’s algorithm to attract recruiters in the Data Science space.
