## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a **classical extractive summarization pipeline** using word-frequency scoring and sentence ranking. It prioritizes **clarity, explainability, and performance**, making it ideal for interviews, demos, and learning NLP basics.

---

## ✨ Features

* Extractive summarization using spaCy (`en_core_web_sm`)
* Interactive Streamlit UI with summary length control
* Sentence & token analysis
* Clean, modular, extensible codebase
* Fast execution (no heavy ML models)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Tokenize text using spaCy
2. Compute normalized word frequencies (excluding stopwords)
3. Score sentences based on token importance
4. Select top-K sentences and return them in order

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **spaCy**
* **Streamlit**

Optional: `pdfplumber`, `python-docx`, `pytesseract`
