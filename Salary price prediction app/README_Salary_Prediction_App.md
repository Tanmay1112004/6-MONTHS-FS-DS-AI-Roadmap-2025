# 💼 Salary Prediction App

A clean, production-style **Machine Learning web application** that predicts **salary based on years of experience** using **Simple Linear Regression (SLR)**.

This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow:

> **Data → Model Training → Model Serialization → Interactive Web App → Deployment**

Simple problem. Strong fundamentals. Real-world execution.
