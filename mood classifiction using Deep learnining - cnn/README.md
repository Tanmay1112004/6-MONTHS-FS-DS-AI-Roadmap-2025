# 🎭 Mood Classification using CNN

A **deep learning–based image classification project** that detects human mood as **Happy 😊** or **Sad 😢** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.
Developed with **TensorFlow/Keras** and deployed via **Gradio** for an intuitive, real-time web experience.

> Built for clarity, accuracy, and real-world usability.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

* **Conv2D + MaxPooling** × 3
* **Dense (256 units)** + Dropout (0.4)
* **Output Layer:** Dense (1, Sigmoid)

**Training Configuration**

* Optimizer: `Adam`
* Loss Function: `binary_crossentropy`
* Evaluation Metric: `accuracy`

Balanced, lightweight, and effective for binary image classification.
